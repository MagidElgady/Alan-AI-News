This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

# Requirements
To install the Alan AI button 
import alanBtn from '@alan-ai/alan-sdk-web';

Required for scroll function 
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

Used to convert spoken number from words to a number e.g. 'four' becomes 4
import wordsToNumbers from 'words-to-numbers';

Material UI used for the font, grid styling and grow for the animations
import { Grid, Grow, Typography } from '@material-ui/core';


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
